### Introduction

Observations of the time-dependent cosmic-ray Sun shadow have been proven as a valuable diagnostic for the assessment of solar magnetic field models. In this paper, seven years of IceCube data are compared to solar activity and solar magnetic field models. A quantitative comparison of solar magnetic field models with IceCube data on the event rate level is performed for the first time. Additionally, a first energy-dependent analysis is presented and compared to recent predictions. We use seven years of IceCube data for the moon and the Sun and compare them to simulations on data rate level. The simulations are performed for the geometrical shadow hypothesis for the moon and the Sun and for a cosmic-ray propagation model governed by the solar magnetic field for the case of the Sun. We find that a linearly decreasing relationship between Sun shadow strength and solar activity is preferred over a constant relationship at the 6.4σ level. We test two commonly used models of the coronal magnetic field, both combined with a Parker spiral, by modeling cosmic-ray propagation in the solar magnetic field. Both models predict a weakening of the shadow in times of high solar activity as it is also visible in the data. We find tensions with the data on the order of 3σ for both models, assuming only statistical uncertainties. The magnetic field model CSSS fits the data slightly better than the PFSS model. This is generally consistent with what is found previously by the Tibet AS-γ Experiment; a deviation of the data from the two models is, however, not significant at this point. Regarding the energy dependence of the Sun shadow, we find indications that the shadowing effect increases with energy during times of high solar activity, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

In contrast, the Sun’s shadow varies seasonally, with IceCube detecting a significant deviation from the mean Sun shadow (χ²/ndof = 22.47/4, 3.8σ). This variation is likely linked to changes in the Sun’s magnetic field, consistent with past Tibet observations at lower energies. A Spearman’s rank test suggests a 96% likelihood of correlation between sunspot number and the Sun shadow’s amplitude. However, given the limited observation periods and a weak solar cycle, further data are needed to confirm this relationship. Future studies should refine models of cosmic ray deflection by solar magnetic fields and improve point spread function treatments to enhance comparisons between observational data and simulations.

### Publication of IceCube research

The investigations on the Sun's cosmic-ray shadow's time variabilities were published in [The Astrophysical Journal](https://dx.doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aaffd1). A more detailed study was published in [Physical Review D](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.042005) where the Sun shadow's time variability is associated to solar cycles, as opposed to the constant Moon cosmic-ray shadow, whose slow variability with time is only associated to the change in average Moon-Earth's distance.

### Publication of numerical calculations

The latest observational result was paired with a dedicated study of cosmic-ray particle trajectories propagating near the Sun, assuming different models of the solar corona's magnetic field and its variability across the solar cycles. The report was published in [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201936306).

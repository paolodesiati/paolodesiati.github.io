### Introduction

The IceCube and the HAWC observatories have established themselves as leaders in studying Galactic cosmic-ray anisotropy in the TeV–PeV energy range. IceCube captures anisotropy amplitudes with high precision by mapping cosmic-ray arrival directions relative to an isotropic reference. The IceTop surface array detects showers above 500 TeV, while the deep in-ice array records muons down to 10 TeV, both closely aligning with primary cosmic-ray directions. HAWC gamma-ray array detects showers above 1-10 TeV. IceCube and HAWC’s continuous sky observation enhances measurement stability, enabling energy-dependent anisotropy studies and spherical harmonic expansion analysis.

Recent findings highlight the dipole component’s amplitude and phase as indicators of cosmic-ray diffusion in interstellar plasma. The angular power spectrum at different energies reflects pitch angle scattering processes. IceCube has submitted results from 12 years (2011–2023) of cosmic-ray muon data, refining event selection for improved stability. High-resolution sky maps will explore temporal anisotropy variations and cross-check muon and shower data consistency.  

IceCube also analyzes the Compton-Getting effect for calibration and cosmic-ray spectral index measurement. Given individual experiments’ limited sky coverage, full-sky measurements via collaborations with HAWC, GRAPES-3, TALE, and KASCADE aim to provide a comprehensive view of anisotropy. These efforts will improve understanding of cosmic-ray diffusion and heliospheric influence on observed distributions.

### Observation of Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy in the Southern Hemisphere with 12 yr of Data Collected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory

In our [latest IceCube publication](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/adb1de), we report a definitive, high-statistics view of TeV–PeV cosmic-ray anisotropy in the Southern Hemisphere using 7.92×10¹¹ cosmic-ray–induced muon events collected by the fully built detector between May 13, 2011 and May 12, 2023. With improved simulations and uniform, year-by-year processing, systematic uncertainties are reduced to levels below statistical fluctuations. The data confirm the long-noted evolution of the anisotropy’s angular structure between \~10 TeV and 1 PeV—most prominently across 100–300 TeV—and, for the first time in IceCube, present energy-dependent angular power spectra that show comparatively diminished large-scale power at the highest energies while retaining significant medium/small-scale structure down to \~6°.

Methodologically, the analysis builds reference maps via 24-hour time-scrambling and quantifies relative intensity per sky pixel, with top-hat smoothing (typically 20°; 5° for certain low-energy residual maps) used only for visualization; the median angular resolution is \~3° and reaches \~1° above 100 TeV. Systematics from the interference between sidereal anisotropy and the solar Compton–Getting effect are controlled by analyzing full calendar years and by checking the antisidereal frame; the resulting systematic spreads are now comparable to statistical errors—a marked improvement over earlier IceCube work.

Physically, the horizontal (equatorial) dipole component behaves as in other experiments: its amplitude decreases from \~10 TeV to just above 100 TeV—reaching a minimum of ≈2×10⁻⁴ while its phase flips from \~RA 50° to \~RA 260°—then rises again with energy. At \~5.3 PeV, the dipole is only marginally distinguishable from isotropy, yielding a 99%-CL upper limit of 3.34×10⁻³. The measured dipole phase and amplitude align with Northern-hemisphere results once field-of-view biases in one-dimensional fits are corrected, reinforcing a coherent, largely horizontal large-scale pattern across both hemispheres.

IceCube’s event selection and reconstruction underpin these results: the detector triggers at 2.0–2.3 kHz on muon bundles that track the parent cosmic-ray directions to within a few degrees, and a compact “DST” data stream preserves the essential kinematics for anisotropy analyses over the full 12-year exposure. Residual maps—after subtracting dipole and quadrupole—reveal persistent smaller-scale structure at both low (<18 TeV) and high (>320 TeV) energies. Together, these advances deliver the most precise Southern-sky anisotropy maps to date and a clean baseline for future joint, full-sky studies that probe how the anisotropy’s scale mix evolves with energy.

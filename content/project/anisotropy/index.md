The IceCube and the HAWC observatories have established themselves as leaders in studying Galactic cosmic-ray anisotropy in the TeV–PeV energy range. IceCube captures anisotropy amplitudes with high precision by mapping cosmic-ray arrival directions relative to an isotropic reference. The IceTop surface array detects showers above 500 TeV, while the deep in-ice array records muons down to 10 TeV, both closely aligning with primary cosmic-ray directions. HAWC gamma-ray array detects showers above 1-10 TeV. IceCube and HAWC’s continuous sky observation enhances measurement stability, enabling energy-dependent anisotropy studies and spherical harmonic expansion analysis.

Recent findings highlight the dipole component’s amplitude and phase as indicators of cosmic-ray diffusion in interstellar plasma. The angular power spectrum at different energies reflects pitch angle scattering processes. IceCube has submitted results from 12 years (2011–2023) of cosmic-ray muon data, refining event selection for improved stability. High-resolution sky maps will explore temporal anisotropy variations and cross-check muon and shower data consistency.  

IceCube also analyzes the Compton-Getting effect for calibration and cosmic-ray spectral index measurement. Given individual experiments’ limited sky coverage, full-sky measurements via collaborations with HAWC, GRAPES-3, TALE, and KASCADE aim to provide a comprehensive view of anisotropy. These efforts will improve understanding of cosmic-ray diffusion and heliospheric influence on observed distributions.

This is a list of cosmic-ray anisotropy published by the team.

CREW-HaT stands for Cosmic Radiation Extended Warding using the Halbach Torus.

### NIAC Phase I 2022

The [CREW-HaT project](https://www.nasa.gov/general/crew-hat-cosmic-radiation-extended-warding-using-the-halbach-torus/) was awarded the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts - [NIAC Phase I](https://www.nasa.gov/general/niac-2022-phase-i-and-phase-ii-selections/) award in 2022.

The 21st century will be when human space exploration gets off the ground. NASA’s priority is to send humans back to the Moon in 2024 with the Artemis mission and travel to Mars in the next decade. In parallel, SpaceX and Blue Origin companies are developing the technology to make human access to space routine. However, achieving this goal is only possible if we can protect the humans we send to space from the damaging effects of cosmic rays and energetic solar radiation. The health risks to astronauts associated with chronic exposure to radiation in space include carcinogenesis, cardiovascular damage, and degradation of the central nervous system. Since the Earth’s magnetic field is responsible for protecting us on Earth’s surface, a logical solution to the problem would be to have a spacecraft bring along its equivalent magnetic field. Here we propose CREW HaT, a new concept for a Halbach Torus (HaT), which consists of light, deployable, mechanically supported magnetic coils activated by a new generation of high-temperature superconducting tapes which have recently become available. This configuration produces an enhanced external magnetic field that diverts cosmic radiation particles, complemented by a suppressed magnetic field in the astronaut’s habitat. The HaT geometry has never been explored before in this context or studied in combination with modern superconductive tapes.  It diverts over 50% of the biology-damaging cosmic rays (protons below 1 GeV) and higher energy high-Z ions. This is sufficient to reduce the radiation dose absorbed by astronauts to a level that is <5% of the lifetime excess risk of cancer mortality levels established by NASA.

### Innovaton

Future human space expeditions announced by NASA (Artemis mission in 2024, Mars mission within the next decade) will only be possible if we efficiently mitigate the effects of harmful cosmic radiation on astronauts. Among the feasible solutions is to surround the spacecraft with protective magnetic fields which divert cosmic radiation with a lightweight and non-cost-prohibitive structure.

- The CREW HaT consists of a Halbach Torus (HaT), a novel arrangement comprising spatially rotating coils around the spacecraft. This configuration produces an enhanced external magnetic field (open magnetic field) to divert cosmic radiation particles, complemented by a reduced magnetic field in the astronauts’ habitat. CREW HaT is likely to be the most feasible solution for active shielding, which this proposal intends to demonstrate.

- The CREW HaT is a deployable device integrated with the spacecraft that unfolds and generates a magnetic field that deflects cosmic radiation, consisting of solar wind particles and galactic cosmic rays.

- Recent innovations in high-temperature superconductors (e.g. ReBCO) enable the high currents that are necessary.

### Potential & Benefits

The CREW-HaT is superior to existing benchmark active shielding technology previously proposed (MAARSS Soleinoidal Coil system by Westover et al., NIAC 2012). It greatly reduces the health risk for astronauts because:

- It diverts over 50% of the biology-damaging cosmic rays (protons below 1 GeV) and higher energy high-Z ions. This is sufficient to reduce the radiation dose absorbed by astronauts to a level that is <5% of the lifetime excess risk of cancer mortality levels established by NASA.

- It has over 80% smaller support structure volume, thus reducing secondary radiation, X-rays, gamma-rays and neutrons produced by the impact of cosmic rays with spacecraft. Previous magnetic topologies (e.g the MAARSS system) did not fully address this problem.

- It suppresses the magnetic field in the astronauts’ habitat, without the need of additional compensation coil. This increases crew safety and prolongs the lifetime of the instrumentation without increasing weight and power consumption.

- This innovative concept provides the aerospace community a solution to protect humans as well as instrumentation on satellites exposed to space radiation from catastrophic solar flares and cosmic ray particles. It can protect any spacecraft or surface installation on, e.g., the Moon, while also making long-duration space trips to Mars possible.

### Innovaton

Future human space expeditions announced by NASA (Artemis mission in 2024, Mars mission within the next decade) will only be possible if we efficiently mitigate the effects of harmful cosmic radiation on astronauts. Among the feasible solutions is to surround the spacecraft with protective magnetic fields which divert cosmic radiation with a lightweight and non-cost-prohibitive structure.

- The CREW HaT consists of a Halbach Torus (HaT), a novel arrangement comprising spatially rotating coils around the spacecraft. This configuration produces an enhanced external magnetic field (open magnetic field) to divert cosmic radiation particles, complemented by a reduced magnetic field in the astronauts’ habitat. CREW HaT is likely to be the most feasible solution for active shielding, which this proposal intends to demonstrate.

- The CREW HaT is a deployable device integrated with the spacecraft that unfolds and generates a magnetic field that deflects cosmic radiation, consisting of solar wind particles and galactic cosmic rays.

- Recent innovations in high-temperature superconductors (e.g. ReBCO) enable the high currents that are necessary.

### Potential & Benefits

The CREW-HaT is superior to existing benchmark active shielding technology previously proposed (MAARSS Soleinoidal Coil system by Westover et al., NIAC 2012). It greatly reduces the health risk for astronauts because:

- It diverts over 50% of the biology-damaging cosmic rays (protons below 1 GeV) and higher energy high-Z ions. This is sufficient to reduce the radiation dose absorbed by astronauts to a level that is <5% of the lifetime excess risk of cancer mortality levels established by NASA.

- It has over 80% smaller support structure volume, thus reducing secondary radiation, X-rays, gamma-rays and neutrons produced by the impact of cosmic rays with spacecraft. Previous magnetic topologies (e.g the MAARSS system) did not fully address this problem.

- It suppresses the magnetic field in the astronauts’ habitat, without the need of additional compensation coil. This increases crew safety and prolongs the lifetime of the instrumentation without increasing weight and power consumption.

- This innovative concept provides the aerospace community a solution to protect humans as well as instrumentation on satellites exposed to space radiation from catastrophic solar flares and cosmic ray particles. It can protect any spacecraft or surface installation on, e.g., the Moon, while also making long-duration space trips to Mars possible.

   summary: |
     The fellowship was awarded to work as a postdoc at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Zeuthen (Germany). The project was the study of cosmic-ray-induced neutrinos and muons collected by the AMANDA neutrino telescope at the geographic South Pole. I was also actively involved in constructing the AMANDA experiment in the antarctic summer of 2000 and deploying a control system for the so-called *digitally controlled Analog Optical Modules* (dAOM) in 2001. The dAOMs were a possible technology for the future of neutrino observatories, at the time.

   summary: |
     The fellowship was awarded to perform research with the Large Volume Detector (LVD) at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (Italy) toward my master's thesis (Tesi di Laurea). The work was the analysis of cosmic-ray events collected by the LVD experiment to investigate the muon events for different cosmic-ray mass composition models.

#      Learned:
#      - Synthesize your own blockchain solutions
#      - Gain an in-depth understanding of the specific mechanics of Bitcoin
#      - Understand Bitcoin’s real-life applications and learn how to attack and destroy Bitcoin, Ethereum, smart contracts and Dapps, and alternatives to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm

#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Paolo Desiati is a research professor at the Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center (WIPAC), a center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. His research focuses on cosmic ray physics through his work with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO), performing experimental analyses and simulation studies of cosmic rays. He collaborates with various teams to create multi-experiment combined analyses, aiming to provide comprehensive insights into the complexities of cosmic rays. Additionally, Paolo conducts numerical calculations of particle trajectories using computational astrophysical magnetic field models to develop theoretical frameworks for testing against observational data.

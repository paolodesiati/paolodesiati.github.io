### ME students' aerospace projects

#### InterEgr 170 (Fall 2020)
  - Investigating the possibility of designing and building an active shield device capable of diverting energetic charged particles from a region of space. Its naturally occurring magnetic field protects Earth from energetic solar and cosmic ray particle radiation. Electric currents create magnetic fields. By directing such currents through appropriately chosen conductor geometries, it is possible to shape the configuration of the magnetic field. Magnetic fields bend charged particle trajectories through the Lorentz force. An appropriately configured magnetic field can focus particles onto a specific region in phase space or divert them away.

#### EMA 569 (Spring 2021)
  - Exposure to ionizing radiation in space limits manned space travel beyond Earth. NASA plans to return astronauts to the moon by the end of this decade, but lunar orbit lies outside Earth’s magnetosphere, which protects against charged particles. The lunar environment exposes astronauts to over three times the radiation dose of the ISS; each day in lunar orbit equals a year’s worth on Earth. CREW HaT aims to reduce astronaut exposure to this radiation during extended missions aboard NASA’s Lunar Gateway Orbiter. It features a design mounted to the Habitat and Logistics Outpost (HALO) module, using eight superconductive coils in a Halbach array to deflect charged radiation. This report assesses CREW HaT’s feasibility and provides background on the problem and existing technologies. It presents a particle simulation model validated by case studies, optimizing the Halbach array's geometry to reduce weight and enhance radiation shielding. The magnetic interactions between superconducting coils impose multi-ton forces, influencing the design and highlighting components needing technological advancement. The total mass and launch feasibility of CREW HaT falls below that of other magnetic shielding proposals. Lastly, a future work section outlines further efforts for the project. The authors conclude that with moderate technological advancements and investment, the CREW HaT system can provide adequate protection from the space environment.

#### EMA 469 (Fall 2021)
  - Radiation exposure is a critical challenge for extended space missions beyond Earth's magnetosphere, posing severe health risks to astronauts. With NASA's upcoming Artemis mission and the development of the Lunar Gateway’s Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), new shielding methods are essential to ensure astronaut safety. Traditional passive shielding, which relies on insulating spacecraft walls, may be insufficient for long-term missions. Consequently, an active shielding system using a Halbach array of superconducting coils has been proposed to generate a protective magnetic field around HALO, mimicking Earth's magnetosphere. The AEGIS system, an evolution of the 2021 CREWHaT design, enhances the Halbach array by optimizing its transport and installation. It comprises eight superconductive coils arranged to deflect radiation, mounted to the HALO module. One of the main engineering challenges is managing the immense magnetic forces between these coils while ensuring structural integrity and precise positioning. To address this, the project developed a star-shaped static support structure made from a titanium alloy, designed to maintain coil placement within 3.3 mm of their intended positions. The structure is modular, transported in sections aboard SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, and assembled in lunar orbit. Using Pareto optimization software and finite element analysis, the design minimizes stress concentrations while ensuring sufficient rigidity. A one-tenth scale prototype was constructed to validate the concept, confirming that the structure can withstand expected forces with a safety factor of 10. The final design weighs approximately 14,137 kg and requires two Falcon 9 launches. Future work includes further analysis of coil behavior, packaging optimizations, and reducing the number of structural components. If successfully implemented, AEGIS could significantly reduce radiation exposure for astronauts aboard the Lunar Gateway, paving the way for safer long-term space exploration.

#### ME 352 (Fall 2023)
  - This report outlines the ongoing development of a radiation shield for long-term space travel using superconducting coils arranged in a Halbach array to generate a protective magnetic field. Building on the Crew-HaT design, Shield Team Six focuses on structural components, including internal coil support, beam support, and mounting connections. The Halbach array consists of magnets oriented both radially outward and tangentially to the spacecraft, experiencing significant forces—17.6 MN in shear compression and 11.1 MN in tensile stress, causing a “Pringle chip” shape. Due to these extreme forces, structural simulations using SolidWorks and Ansys were conducted to optimize support designs. The team’s primary focus has been on the internal coil support, particularly for coils under shear compressive loads. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) helped assess stress, displacement, and strain, guiding design improvements. NASA’s goal is to limit coil displacement to 0.02 mm, though current results exceed this threshold. However, iterative simulations indicate progress toward achieving this target. Further refinements in material selection, software integration, and communication are essential to enhancing the design. Shield Team Six remains committed to advancing structural integrity, contributing to the feasibility of deep-space exploration.

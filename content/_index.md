      subtitle: ''

        I am a research scientist working in cosmic-ray physics for over 20 years. My current activities are:

        IceCube- Leading the cosmic-ray analyses in IceCube since 2006. Co-PI of the current IceCube Cosmic Ray
    Analysis sub-award (funded by NSF; UWâ€“Madison PI: Desiati). I lead a working group on cosmic-ray anisotropy
    analyses, including Prof. Rasha Abbasi (Loyola University Chicago), Prof. Frank McNally (Mercer University),
    and Dr. Juan Carlos DÃ­az VÃ©lez (WIPAC).
    
    IceCube- Collaboration with Prof. Julia Becker Tjus (University of Bochum, Germany) and the Bochum group on
    the observation of the cosmic-ray shadow cast by the Moon and the Sun using IceCube data and the numerical
    calculation of cosmic-ray particle trajectories around the Sun at different phases of the solar cycle.

    HAWC- Combined analysis of 10 TeV cosmic-ray anisotropy with the HAWC and the IceCube neutrino observatories
    (with Dr. Juan Carlos DÃ­az VÃ©lez). I am working on an overhaul of cosmic-ray anisotropy analysis in the 1-100
    TeV energy range, using eight years of HAWC data. And on the HAWC/IceCube combined analysis in the 10-100 TeV
    energy range (funded by NSF grant; PI: Desiati). An MoU between IceCube and HAWC was established.

    SWGO- Collaboration member of the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) and member of the Cosmic
    Ray task force aimed to establish requirements for high-energy cosmic anisotropy observations.

    GRAPES-3- Collaboration with the GRAPES-3 extensive air shower experiment (located in Ooty, India) aimed to
    perform a combined analysis of cosmic-ray anisotropy with IceCube in the energy range of 10-100 TeV. An MoU
    between IceCube and GRAPES-3 was established.

    Numerical Calculations- Collaboration with Prof. Nikolai Pogorelov (Univ. of Alabama - Huntsville), Prof.
    Zhang Ming (Florida Institute of Technology), and Dr. Vanessa LÃ³pez Barquero (University of Maryland) on
    the heliosphereâ€™s distortion effects on the arrival direction distribution of TeV cosmic rays and the
    unfolding of the interstellar diffusion properties.

abstract: 'Recent experimental results on the arrival direction of high-energy cosmic
  rays have motivated studies to understand their propagating environment. The observed
  anisotropy is shaped by interstellar and local magnetic fields. In coherent magnetic
  structures, such as the heliosphere, or due to magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, magnetic
  mirroring can temporarily trap particles, leading to chaotic behavior. In this work,
  we develop a new method to characterize cosmic rays’ chaotic behavior in magnetic
  systems using finite-time Lyapunov exponents. This quantity determines the degree
  of chaos and adapts to transitory behavior. We study particle trajectories in an
  axial-symmetric magnetic bottle to highlight mirroring effects. By introducing time-dependent
  magnetic perturbations, we study how temporal variations affect chaotic behavior.
  We tailor our model to the heliosphere; however, it can represent diverse magnetic
  configurations exhibiting mirroring phenomena. Our results have three key implications.
  (1) Theoretical: We find a correlation between the finite-time Lyapunov exponent
  and the particle escape time from the system, which follows a power law that persists
  even under additional perturbations. This power law may reveal intrinsic system
  characteristics, offering insight into propagation dynamics beyond simple diffusion.
  (2) Simulation: Chaotic effects play a role in cosmic-ray simulations and can influence
  the resulting anisotropy maps. (3) Observational: Arrival maps display areas where
  the chaotic properties vary significantly; these changes can be the basis for time
  variability in the anisotropy maps. This work lays the framework for studying the
  effects of magnetic mirroring of cosmic rays within the heliosphere and the role
  of temporal variability in the observed anisotropy.'

abstract: At the dawn of a new space exploration age, aiming to send humans back to the Moon and for the first time to Mars, it is necessary to devise a solution to mitigate the impact that space radiation has on spacecraft and astronauts. Although technically challenging, active magnetic shielding is generally considered a promising solution. We propose a lightweight deployable system producing an open magnetic field around a space habitat. Our Cosmic Radiation Extended Warding (CREW) system consists of a cylindrical Halbach array coil arrangement, or Halbach Torus (HaT). This configuration generates an enhanced external magnetic field while suppressing it in the habitat volume. The CREW HaT takes advantage of recent innovations in high-temperature superconductors (e.g., ReBCO) that enables the needed high currents. We present a preliminary feasibility design of the magnetic shielding system and its collapsible mechanical structure to sustain the internal magnetic forces while protecting astronauts. We also lay down the next steps towards a more evolved and comprehensive design of the device.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

abstract: Seasonal variations of atmospheric muons are traditionally interpreted in
  terms of an effective temperature that relates the atmospheric temperature profile
  at a given time to the dependence of muon production on atmospheric depth. This
  paper aims to review and generalize the treatment of muon production and effective
  temperature that has been used to interpret seasonal variations of atmospheric muons
  by many experiments. The formalism is developed both in integral form – for application
  to compact detectors at a fixed depth that record all muons with Eμ>Eμmin – and
  in differential form — for application to extended detectors like IceCube, KM3NeT,
  and Baikal-GVD, where the rates are proportional to energy-dependent effective areas.

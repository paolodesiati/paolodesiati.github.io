      title: Cosmic Ray Anisotropy Workshop
      text: |-
        The UW-madison cosmic-ray team created a multidisciplinary community of researchers (astrophysics, 
        heliophysics, plasma physics, astronomy, 
        including the interstellar medium) to exchange ideas and models on cosmic ray anisotropy and particle 
        propagation as well as heliospheric and interstellar medium properties. We meet biennially at the Cosmic Ray 
        Anisotropy Workshop to discuss and summarize our research. Our discussions have inspired new ideas, 
        collaborations, and research questions. Action items included: 1) Sharing advanced computational heliospheric 
        models to assess the heliosphere’s impact on cosmic-ray particles traveling to Earth. 2) Noting that progress 
        in astrophysics necessitates collaboration between cosmic-ray experiment teams to improve detection instruments 
        and results. 3) Recognizing that astrophysicists often oversimplify the Milky Way model when studying cosmic- 
        ray diffusion, neglecting its inhomogeneity, which more recent models now aim to address.
